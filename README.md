This is my fork of nuscenes-devkit.

The original repository requires Python 3.6 or 3.7, and its support for newer versions of Python is relatively conservative. This repository will abandon support for older versions of Python and support Python 3.12 or later.

See the original README.md at [here](./README_original.md).
